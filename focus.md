## Focus

When making a Task roll, if one of your character’s **Focuses** applies and you’re using a Discipline they have **at least 1 point in**, any die roll that is **equal to or less than that Discipline value** counts as **two successes** instead of one.

This is known as the **Focus range**. For example, a character with **Conn 3** crits on rolls of **1–3**, while a character with **Science 5** crits on **1–5**.

Focuses make it easier to generate **Momentum** or overcome **high Difficulty** Tasks. They don’t alter your target number (Attribute + Discipline); they just define when you score extra successes.

Focuses are **broad and narrative** rather than strict keywords—if a player can justify how a Focus applies, the GM may approve it.
Examples: *Astrophysics*, *Negotiation*, *Hand-to-Hand Combat*, *Starship Helm Operations*.

Starships use the same principle: their Departments act as their Disciplines. For instance, a ship with **Conn 3** has a Focus range of **1–3** for piloting Tasks. Some Talents can modify this range, such as **[[Hands-on Pilot]]**, which allows a ship’s Focus range to be doubled (Conn 3 → 1–6) when that pilot performs maneuvers like **Warp**, **Evasive Action**, or **Attack Pattern**.
