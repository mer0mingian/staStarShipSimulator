# Constitution-Class Starship

## Launch Year
2243

## Overview

The symbol of Starfleet in the mid-to-late 23rd century, the *Constitution* class became legendary due to its five-year missions that expanded the Federation's borders and its scientific knowledge. The *Constitution* class became the testbed of new technologies in the early 2270s developed out of the five-year missions and lessons learned from the brief war with the Klingon Empire. The spaceframe continued in service until the mid-24th century.

## Capabilities

The *Constitution* class defined what a starship should be able to accomplish when on extended deep-space exploration assignments. The spaceframe had accommodations for over 400 crew members, enough to provide redundancy for crew positions ranging from astrocartographers to xenobiologists, allowing for crew losses typical on five-year missions. The ship had a spacious shuttlebay and cargo area at the aft of the secondary hull that allowed the class to move large amounts of supplies or personnel even without the use of transporters.

## Refits and Variants

Vessels produced by other founding members of the Federation tended to focus on their own fleets' specialties. Andorian-built vessels had larger fusion reactors and Tellarite-built vessels sought after for their powerful duotronic computer networks. Vulcan-produced vessels focused on improving sensors and communications.

## Suggested Mission Profiles

Multirole Explorer, Strategic and Diplomatic Operations, Flagship, Scientific and Survey Operations.

## Naming Conventions

*Constitution*-class vessels are often named after famous Earth navy vessels and pre-warp spacecraft. Registry numbers range between 1700 and 1799, though there are exceptions.

**Notable Examples:** U.S.S. *Enterprise* (NCC-1701), U.S.S. *Lexington* (NCC-1709), U.S.S. *Defiant* (NCC-1764), U.S.S. *Challenger* (NCC-2023)
