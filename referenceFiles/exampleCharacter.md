### 💬 Notes
Velnar is a holographic construct created as part of the *Simulacra Nocturne* training program aboard the USS *Pathfinder*. Designed to emulate a moral and tactical dilemma, his programming is built around desperation, guilt, and the rationalization of unethical acts in the name of loyalty.  
Unlike Riot-7, Velnar exhibits no self-awareness; he exists purely to test cadet decision-making under emotional strain. His realism and emotional nuance, however, have caused more than one trainee to forget he isn’t real.
