# Basic Operations Reference

## Scenes and Structure

**Scene:** Basic unit of gameplay covering a few minutes to an hour. Characters attempt goals, overcome problems, engage in significant activities.

**Scene Transitions:** Skip uninteresting parts, move to new location/characters when conflict resolved.

**Encounters:** Tightly structured scenes with conflict divided into rounds and turns (see Conflict chapter).

## Traits

**Definition:** Single word or short phrase describing significant fact about character, location, situation, or equipment.

### Trait Categories

| Category | Applies To | Duration | Examples |
|----------|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Situation** | Current situation | Scene only | Darkness, Signal Jamming |
| **Location** | Current location | Permanent (or as location) | Derelict Romulan Starship, Crumbling Cavern, Well-Stocked Sickbay |
| **Character** | Character/creature | Permanent or temporary | Species, Reputation, Injuries, Strong Emotions |
| **Equipment** | Single item | Permanent (while functional) | Tricorder, Medical Kit |

### Trait Effects

Traits prompt GM to rule specific way on actions:
- **Helpful trait:** Makes action easier or produces benefit
- **Troublesome trait:** Makes action harder or creates problems
- May make something **possible** that couldn't normally be done
- May make something **impossible** that could normally be done

**Test Statement:** "Because I am/have/of [trait], this activity is [easier/harder/possible/impossible/unchanged]"

### Changing Traits

**Create/Change/Remove Trait:** Task (Difficulty 2), attribute + department based on action taken.

**Potent Traits:** Single trait with effect of many. Noted with number after name (e.g., Thick Smoke 2). Normal traits = Potency 1 (no notation needed).

**Adjusting Potency:** When creating trait, may instead increase/decrease existing trait's Potency by 1.

## Tasks

### Task Decision Process

GM responds to player intent with:
- **YES:** Achieve goal without effort
- **NO:** Cannot achieve goal (at least not now)
- **MAYBE:** Success uncertain → Roll task

### Task Attempt Process

1. **Select Attribute + Department:** Add ratings = target number
2. **Select Focus:** If applicable
3. **Set Difficulty:** GM determines (typically 0-5)
4. **Build Dice Pool:** Start with 2d20, add bonus dice
5. **Roll Dice:** Each d20 ≤ target number = 1 success
6. **Determine Success:** Successes ≥ Difficulty = success
7. **Generate Momentum:** Extra successes become Momentum

### Target Number

**Target Number** = Attribute Rating + Department Rating

### Success Types

| Roll Result | Success Type | Effect |
|-------------|--------------|--------|
| ≤ Department rating (with applicable focus) | **Critical Success** | 2 successes |
| Roll of 1 (without applicable focus) | **Critical Success** | 2 successes |
| ≤ Target number | **Success** | 1 success |
| Roll of 20 or within complication range | **Complication** | Creates problem |

### Difficulty Examples

| Difficulty | Example Tasks |
|-----------|---------------|
| **0** | Widely-known research, training target, routine maintenance |
| **1** | Specialized research, melee combat, emergency power reroute |
| **2** | Obscure research, phaser attack, repairs under fire |
| **3** | Restricted research, attack in poor light, improvised repairs |
| **4** | Classified research, attack on defended position in poor light, incompatible tech integration |
| **5** | Redacted research, small fast-moving target in poor light, transport at warp |

### Difficulty Zero Tasks

**Automatic Success:** No roll needed, 0 successes, no complications, **no Momentum**.

**Optional Roll:** May roll to generate Momentum but risks complications.

## Improving Odds

### Buying Additional d20s

**Maximum:** 5d20 total per task

| Method | Cost | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| **Momentum** | 1st die: 1, 2nd die: 2, 3rd die: 3 | Before roll |
| **Threat** | 1st die: 1, 2nd die: 2, 3rd die: 3 | Before roll |
| **Determination** | Varies | See Determination section |
| **Talents** | Varies | May reduce costs |

### Determination (Before Roll)

**Perfect Opportunity:** Select one d20, set to 1 (critical success)

### Determination (After Roll)

**Moment of Inspiration:** Re-roll any number of d20s

## Teamwork and Assistance

**Leader:** Character attempting task  
**Assistants:** Characters helping

**Cost:**
- First assistant: Free
- Each additional assistant: 1 Momentum OR 1 Threat

**Process:**
1. Assistant describes how they help
2. Each assistant rolls 1d20 (own target number, own focus)
3. If leader scores ≥1 success: add assistant successes
4. If leader scores 0 successes: task fails regardless

**Notes:**
- Assistants may use different attribute/department/focus
- Assistants always roll 1d20 only
- In combat: assisting uses character's turn

## Opposed Tasks

**Active Character:** Attempting action  
**Reactive Character:** Resisting/avoiding

**Process:**
1. Reactive character rolls first, count successes
2. Reactive successes = Difficulty for active character
3. Active character attempts task vs that Difficulty
4. If active succeeds: achieve goal, spend Momentum
5. If active fails: reactive gets Momentum = (Difficulty - successes scored)

**External Factors:**
- Factors hindering reactive: reduce Difficulty they set by 1 per factor (min 0)
- Factors affecting active: adjust final Difficulty as normal

## Complications

**Trigger:** Roll of 20 (or within complication range)

**Effect:** Creates problem after task resolved

**Buy Off:** Add 2 Threat to ignore complication

### Complication Range

| Range | Complication On |
|-------|----------------|
| 1 (normal) | 20 |
| 2 | 19-20 |
| 3 | 18-20 |
| 4 | 17-20 |
| 5 (maximum) | 16-20 |

**Increases:** Traits, GM spending Threat, inherently uncertain situations

## Success at Cost

**When Offered:** Tasks that can't truly fail, only succeed with problems

**Effect:** Succeed but suffer one automatic complication (plus any from 20s rolled)

**Limitation:** Cannot spend Momentum on task that succeeded at cost

**Multiple Complications:** GM may increase cost (multiple automatic complications)

## Momentum

**Source:** Extra successes beyond Difficulty

**Group Pool:** Maximum 6 Momentum. Excess lost if not spent.

**Scene End:** Remove 1 Momentum from pool

### Common Momentum Spends

| Spend | Cost | Type | Effect |
|-------|------|------|--------|
| **Create Opportunity (buy d20s)** | 1/2/3 | Immediate, Repeatable | Add d20s before task (1st: 1, 2nd: 2 more, 3rd: 3 more) |
| **Create Trait** | 2 | — | Establish new trait or change/increase Potency/remove existing trait |
| **Keep Initiative** | 2 | Immediate | Pass action to ally instead of opposition (once per side until opposition acts) |
| **Obtain Information** | 1 | Repeatable | Ask GM question related to task (must answer truthfully) |
| **Reduce Time** | 2 | — | Complete activity in half time (not in action scenes) |
| **Swift Action** | 2 | — | Take additional major action (Difficulty +1). In action scenes only |
| **Extra Minor Action** | 1 | — | Take additional minor action. Each minor action once per turn only |

**Bonus Momentum:** Granted by situations/items/talents. Cannot be saved, must be used immediately or lost. May have restricted uses.

**Immediate Spends:** Can be paid by adding Threat instead of spending Momentum (1 for 1).

## Determination

**Starting:** 1 per mission  
**Maximum:** 3 at any time  
**Source:** Acting in accordance with or against values/directives

### Determination Spends

**Requirement:** One value or directive must align with action

| Spend | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| **Perfect Opportunity** | Before roll (after buying dice): set one d20 to 1 (critical success) |
| **Moment of Inspiration** | After roll: re-roll any number of d20s |
| **Special Technique** | Gain use of single talent you don't possess for rest of scene (must meet prerequisites) |

### Gaining Determination

When value/directive makes situation harder, GM offers choice:

| Choice | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Challenge** | Go against value. Cross out value, continue action, gain 1 Determination. Rewrite value at mission end |
| **Comply** | Give in to value. Suffer complication. Gain 1 Determination |

**Directives:**
- Apply to group for entire mission
- Can be used positively (spend Determination) or negatively (gain Determination)
- Challenging Directive = knowingly disobeying orders

## Threat

**GM Resource:** Similar to Momentum for players

**Starting:** 2 per player character (adjustable based on adventure tone)

### Players Add Threat

| Source | Amount | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Ignoring Complications** | 2 per complication | Instead of suffering complication |
| **Escalation** | 1 | Risky action making situation more dangerous. Lethal force always counts |
| **Immediate Momentum** | 1 per Momentum | Pay for Immediate spends with Threat instead |

### GM Adds Threat

| Source | Amount | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **NPC Momentum** | 1 per Momentum | NPCs can't save Momentum, convert to Threat |
| **Threatening Circumstances** | 1-2 | Dangerous environment, NPC arrival, escalation |

### GM Spends Threat

See Gamemastering chapter for full list. Common uses:
- Empower NPCs
- Alter scenes
- Create consequences
- Increase complications
- Activate NPC abilities

## Re-rolls

**Process:**
1. Choose number of dice to re-roll (up to allowed)
2. Roll those dice
3. New results replace original (even if worse)

**Cannot Refuse:** Must accept new results

## Rounding

Always round up.

## Observation Tasks

**Common Attributes:** Insight, Reason  
**Department:** Varies by situation  
**Difficulty:** Low (success = minimum info, spend Momentum for more)  
**Vital Info:** Use Success at Cost if needed

## Equipment and Technology

**Assumption:** Character has appropriate tools for task

**Without Tools:** Difficulty increases or task becomes impossible

## Treknobabble

**Problem:** Trait in scene  
**Solution:** Trait created by players

**Keep Notes:** Track treknobabble traits for consistency and later reference
