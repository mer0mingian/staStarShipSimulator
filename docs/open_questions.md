# Open Questions - VTT Scope Transition

## Campaign & Session Management

1.  **Momentum Reset**: You mentioned "automated reduction of Momentum when transitioning between scenes". Should Momentum reset to 0 at the start of every Session (new game day), or does it persist indefinitely across Scenes until a Session break?

2.  **Scene Transitions**: When a GM ends a Scene, should the App automatically prompt for the "Connected Scene" (as per your diagram), or is that manual?

3.  **Player Access**: Can Players see all Scenes in a Campaign, or only "Active" ones?

4.  **Turn Order**: Do you want auto-sorting (by Daring + Focus) or manual GM ordering for initiative?

## Scene Data & Persistence

5.  **Scene Data Persistence**: Should a Scene save its state (HP, Stress, etc.) permanently, or is it ephemeral (reset on re-entry)?

6.  **Ship Shields**: Confirm simplified shields (single value) vs quadrant-based (Forward, Aft, Port, Starboard).

## UI/UX & Navigation

7.  **Navigation Priority**: Should the UI overhaul (Milestone 6) focus on:
    -   Campaign selection/dashboard?
    -   Scene management (creation/transition)?
    -   Character/Ship creation flows?
    -   All of the above?

8.  **View Screen**: Should this be a separate route (`/view`) or a mode toggle in the Scene view?

## Data & Migration

9.  **Existing Data**: Is there any existing data (Encounters, Characters) that needs to be migrated to the new Campaign/Scene structure?

10. **Universe Library Structure**: Should the Universe Library support Tags/Categories for organizing Chars/Ships (e.g., "Enemies", "Allies", "Starships")?
